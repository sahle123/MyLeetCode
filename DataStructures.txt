Hash Map:
    - Use cases: Anytime we need key/value pairs. Great for keeping track of how many of some key we have.
    - Complexity: O(1) lookup, O(1) insertion, O(n) size.

Hash Set:
    - Use cases: Anytime we need to keep track of a distinct set of items. Similar to a Hash Map, but narrower applications.
    - Complexity: O(1) lookup, O(1) insertion, O(n) size.
