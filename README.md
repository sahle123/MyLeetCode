# My LeetCode code
# 
Since I work on multiple machines, I like to keep track of all my LeetCode solutions on here. Feel free to take, reuse or do whatever you like. No guarantee it's the best solution or efficient so you've been warned. On a side-note, I encourage those who are lost not to look these up until you've at least attempted to solve the problem by yourself. But hey, I won't tell you how to live your life so have fun! :)
